## About

[Essentials](https://jacobxperez.github.io/essentials/) is a base CSS framework build with [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) intended to be used by small scale web projects. It contains all necessary components to build a website this includes a grid system, typography, navigation, and dropdowns just to name a few.

### Project Status

Project under active development. **NO** stable version has been released.

## Getting Started

Start by **[downloading](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/archive/master.zip)** the [repository](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials) or by cloning the project:

    $ git clone https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials.git

*Keep in mind that this project is under active development and no stable version has been released.*

### Default Build

The easiest way to include [Essentials](https://jacobxperez.github.io/essentials/) in your projects is by copying the pre-compiled CSS file into your project folder and then link to it in HTML.

* [/css/style.css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.css)

### Custom Build

[Essentials](https://jacobxperez.github.io/essentials/) is built on [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) which extends the capabilities of CSS. Use [style.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.less) for compiling all necessary modules for your website. To ensure future compatibility each module has been assigned a unique version.

* [/css/style.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.less)

All components and dependencies can be found under folder [less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less). The folder [components](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/components) contains all CSS modules organized by type. The folder [mixins](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/mixins) is where all LESS functions are kept and the folder [variables](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/var) has all necessary files to adjust the settings of your website.

* [/css/less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less)
    * [components](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/components)
    * [mixins](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/mixins)
    * [var](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/var)

We recommend adding extra modules under folder [custom](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/components/custom) then link to them on file [style.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.less) for compiling.

* [/css/less/components](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/components)
    * [custom](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/components/custom)

## Design Principles

Leo Babauta demonstrates in his book The Power of Less how to streamline your life by identifying the essential and eliminating the unnecessary. By focusing on the essential and allowing everything else to drop away you will become less stressed and more productive.

1. Identify the essential
2. Eliminate the rest
