All the main modules that builds [style.css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.css) can be found under folder [core](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/core).

	* [reset](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/core/reset) (css reset)
	* [layout](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/core/layout) (grid system)
	* [utilities](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/core/utilities) (alignment and other tools)
	* [mixins](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/core/mixins) (LESS mixins)

To ensure future compatibility we recommend to leave all [core](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/core) modules untouched unless you have to, and instead add all custom code on top of it under folder [styles](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/styles) then link to them on file [style.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.less) for compiling.

* [css/less/styles](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/styles)
	* [modules](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/styles/modules) (add custom modules here)
	* [navigation](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/styles/navigation) (add custom navigation here)

*By default Essentials has no predefine navigation, use your own custom code.*

## Design Principles

Leo Babauta demonstrates in he's book The Power of Less how to streamline your life by identifying the essential and eliminating the unnecessary. By focusing on the essential and allowing everything else to drop away you will become less stressed and more productive.

1. Identify the essential
2. Eliminate the rest

> Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
